# C--Visual-ProgrammingProblemSolutions
These are programs that I created to solve the coding problems in Starting out with Visual C# by Tony Gaddis 
Due to the lack of C# filtering ability on GitHub I am zipping the programming problems and projects into the repository. If you want to download the examples and use them for educational purposes, then download the zipped file that you need and extract the folder into a new one on your computer.

Use Visual Studios 2022 to open the sol file. If you have any issues just contact me.
